Intro: 
"The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes."


Elements of the system/ sections of original bitcoin.pdf:
- Transactions (signing transactions w/ unique signatures - private keys)
- Timestamp server (to order the blocks in the chain) - that way theres a chain. This solves the double spending problem.
- Proof of work - for proof of mining, based on a SHA-256 (aka sha-2)
- Network
- Incentive

Extra features:
- Reclaiming Disk space - so bitcoin doesn't take up too much space
- Simplified Payment Verification
- Combining and Splitting Value (more efficient to have 1 transaction with multiple inputs and outputs)
- Privacy everything is public but they are keys - not names - anonymity
- Calculations - low probability / impracticality of someone tkaing over
