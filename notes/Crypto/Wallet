## Wallet

- wallet has a balance of an individual
- wallet has an individuals keys - private (generate signatures) and public (verify signatures)
public address = public key - so that others can send money to the wallet



## Transactions

- input of a transaction: details of the sender, their starting balance, the senders digital signature
- output object 1 : amount field and address field (how much sending to who)
- output object 2 : amount of new balance and own address


## Digital signature

private key + transaction data = "signature"
by using public key, anyone can verify signature and read data behind it
(if the data doesn't match the signature it is not valid)

so we need to...
build wallets
keys for signatures
transaction objects
