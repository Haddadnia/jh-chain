Setup

- using: nodejs/npm, postman, nodemon (dynamic server)
- npm --init -y (yes to everything)
- npm i nodemon --save-dev (save as dev dependency - not a requirement for creating production version)


added a script to package.json in scripts which allows us to run tests (js files) view nodemon and npm run

npm i crypto-js --save (library and dependency used for SHA-256)

npm i jest --save-dev (for testing)
npm i elliptic --save (for key generation)
npm i uuid --save (for universally unique ID)

Using Node / npm, jest for testing, express for the app
Components:

Block
Block chain
Express app
P2P server
Proof of work
Dynamic block difficulty
Elliptic cryptography



THOUGHT - could test making 2 chains which arent yet peers... adding different blocks to the chain... then connect a third with both as peers
