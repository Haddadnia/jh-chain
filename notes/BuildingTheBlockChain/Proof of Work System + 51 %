Proof of Work System + 51 %

- proof of work requires miners to prove they've done work
- any peer can replace the blockchain
- proof of work makes it very expensive to generate corrupt changes
- manageable to submit one block, unproductive to generate an entire chain

"hashcash" proof of work system was created to prevent email spamming

there are difficulties in the system at different times
dif 6 = 6 zeroes leading to find randomly (this sets a rate of mining) - bitcoin allows 1 block every 10 minutes
miner has to generate a bunch of hashes that match the difficulty
a "nonce" value adjusts in order to generate new hashes
nonce value is stored as part of the block

51% attack - a scenario where a dishonest miner has more than 51% of the networks power
it would take billions of dollars to do this to bitcoin, and then you ruined the system you just took over
