Multiple Chain Validation

- miners each need their own version of the chain
if they want to mine - they have to submit it to the system, so everyone can update their chains

- needs to be validation of some sort on the new block

1. longer chains are accepted
- this helps with forking
- the system needs to determine which block to accept
- fork that loses gets added to the end of the longer block

2. Hash validation


P2P web socket server
we use web sockets for the P2P server
apps will either be the first waiting for others to join it, or will be a later server - we'll make one server which can do both


"transaction Pool"
- transactions are unconfirmed until they are mined
